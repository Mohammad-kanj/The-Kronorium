    <img src="img/gamecube.jpg" alt="Gamecube" width="300px" height="200px">
    <p>Nintendo began developing the GameCube in 1998 after entering a partnership with ArtX to design a graphics
        processing unit. The console was formally announced under the codename "Dolphin" the following year, and was
        released in 2001 as the GameCube. It is Nintendo's first console to use its own optical discs instead of ROM
        cartridges, supplemented by writable memory cards for saved games. Unlike its competitors, it is solely focused
        on gaming and does not play mass media like DVD or CD. The console supports limited online gaming for a few
        games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable for
        exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller. The GameCube supports e-Reader
        cards to unlock special features in a few games. The Game Boy Player add-on runs Game Boy, Game Boy Color and
        Game Boy Advance cartridge games.</p>

        featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.</p>
