    <h4 style="font-size: 1.5vw;"><strong>What is Nintendo?</strong></h4>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Nintendo Co., Ltd.[c] is a Japanese multinational video game company headquartered in Kyoto. It
        develops, publishes, and releases both video games and video game consoles.

        The history of Nintendo began when craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi founded the company to produce handmade hanafuda
        playing cards. After venturing into various lines of business and becoming a public company, Nintendo began
        producing toys in the 1960s, and later video games. Nintendo developed its first arcade games in the 1970s, and
        distributed its first system, the Color TV-Game, in 1977. The company became internationally dominant in the
        1980s after the arcade release of Donkey Kong (1981) and the Nintendo Entertainment System, which launched
        outside of Japan alongside Super Mario Bros. in 1985.

        Since then, Nintendo has produced some of the most successful consoles in the video game industry, including the
        Game Boy (1989), the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1991), the Nintendo DS (2004), the Wii (2006), and the
        Nintendo Switch (2017). It has created or published numerous major franchises, including Mario, Donkey Kong, The
        Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Pokémon. The company's mascot, Mario, is among the most famous fictional
        characters, and Nintendo's other characters—including Luigi, Donkey Kong, Samus, Link, Kirby, and Pikachu—have
        attained international recognition. Several films and a theme park area based on the company's franchises have
        been created.</p>
